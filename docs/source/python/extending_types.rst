Extending pyarrow
=================

Controlling conversion to pyarrow.Array with the ``__arrow_array__`` protocol
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The :func:`pyarrow.array` function has built-in support for Python sequences,
numpy arrays and pandas 1D objects (Series, Index, Categorical, ..) to convert
those to Arrow arrays. This can be extended for other array-like objects
by implementing the ``__arrow_array__`` method (similar to numpy's ``__array__``
protocol).

For example, to support conversion of your duck array class to an Arrow array,
define the ``__arrow_array__`` method to return an Arrow array::

    class MyDuckArray:

        ...

        def __arrow_array__(self, type=None):
            # convert the underlying array values to a pyarrow Array
            import pyarrow
            return pyarrow.array(..., type=type)

The ``__arrow_array__`` method takes an optional `type` keyword which is passed
through from :func:`pyarrow.array`.
