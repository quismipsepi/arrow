# Arrow GLib

Arrow GLib is a wrapper library for Arrow C++. Arrow GLib provides C
API.

Arrow GLib supports
[GObject Introspection](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/GObjectIntrospection).
It means that you can create language bindings at runtime or compile time.

For example, you can use Apache Arrow from Ruby by Arrow GLib and
[gobject-introspection gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/gobject-introspection)
with the following code:

```ruby
# Generate bindings at runtime
require "gi"
Arrow = GI.load("Arrow")

# Now, you can access arrow::BooleanArray in Arrow C++ by
# Arrow::BooleanArray
p Arrow::BooleanArray
```

In Ruby case, you should use
[red-arrow gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/red-arrow). It's based on
gobject-introspection gem. It adds many convenient features to raw
gobject-introspection gem based bindings.

## Install

### Package

TODO

### Build

You need to install Arrow C++ before you install Arrow GLib. See Arrow
C++ document about how to install Arrow C++.

You need [GTK-Doc](https://www.gtk.org/gtk-doc/) and
[GObject Introspection](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/GObjectIntrospection)
to build Arrow GLib. You can install them by the followings:

On Debian GNU/Linux or Ubuntu:

```text
% sudo apt install -y -V gtk-doc-tools autoconf-archive libgirepository1.0-dev
```

On CentOS 7 or later:

```text
% sudo yum install -y gtk-doc gobject-introspection-devel
```

On macOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```text
% brew install -y gtk-doc gobject-introspection
```

Now, you can build Arrow GLib:

```text
% cd c_glib
% ./autogen.sh
% ./configure --enable-gtk-doc
% make
% sudo make install
```

## Usage

You can use Arrow GLib with C or other languages. If you use Arrow
GLib with C, you use C API. If you use Arrow GLib with other
languages, you use GObject Introspection based bindings.

### C

You can find API reference in the
`/usr/local/share/gtk-doc/html/arrow-glib/` directory. If you specify
`--prefix` to `configure`, the directory will be different.

You can find example codes in the `example/` directory.

### Language bindings

You can use Arrow GLib with non C languages with GObject Introspection
based bindings. Here are languages that support GObject Introspection:

  * Ruby: [red-arrow gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/red-arrow) should be used.

  * Python: [PyGObject](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/PyGObject) should be used. (Note that you should use PyArrow than Arrow GLib.)

  * Lua: [LGI](https://github.com/pavouk/lgi) should be used.

  * Go: [Go-gir-generator](https://github.com/linuxdeepin/go-gir-generator) should be used.

See also
[Projects/GObjectIntrospection/Users - GNOME Wiki!](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GObjectIntrospection/Users)
for other languages.
