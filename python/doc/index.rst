Apache Arrow (Python)
=====================

Arrow is a columnar in-memory analytics layer designed to accelerate big data.
It houses a set of canonical in-memory representations of flat and hierarchical
data along with multiple language-bindings for structure manipulation. It also
provides IPC and common algorithm implementations.

This is the documentation of the Python API of Apache Arrow. For more details
on the format and other language bindings see
`the main page for Arrow <https://arrow.apache.org/>`_. Here will we only
detail the usage of the Python API for Arrow and the leaf libraries that add
additional functionality such as reading Apache Parquet files into Arrow
structures.
