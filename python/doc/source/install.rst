Install PyArrow
===============

Conda
-----

To install the latest version of PyArrow from conda-forge using conda:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge pyarrow

Pip
---

Install the latest version from PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pyarrow

.. note::
    Currently there are only binary artifcats available for Linux and MacOS.
    Otherwise this will only pull the python sources and assumes an existing
    installation of the C++ part of Arrow.
    To retrieve the binary artifacts, you'll need a recent ``pip`` version that
    supports features like the ``manylinux1`` tag.

Building from source
--------------------

First, clone the master git repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/apache/arrow.git arrow

System requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Building pyarrow requires:

* A C++11 compiler

  * Linux: gcc >= 4.8 or clang >= 3.5
  * OS X: XCode 6.4 or higher preferred

* `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`_

Python requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will need Python (CPython) 2.7, 3.4, or 3.5 installed. Earlier releases and
are not being targeted.

.. note::
    This library targets CPython only due to an emphasis on interoperability with
    pandas and NumPy, which are only available for CPython.

The build requires NumPy, Cython, and a few other Python dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install cython
    cd arrow/python
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Installing Arrow C++ library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, you should choose an installation location for Arrow C++. In the future
using the default system install location will work, but for now we are being
explicit:

.. code-block:: bash

    export ARROW_HOME=$HOME/local

Now, we build Arrow:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd arrow/cpp

    mkdir dev-build
    cd dev-build

    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$ARROW_HOME ..

    make

    # Use sudo here if $ARROW_HOME requires it
    make install

To get the optional Parquet support, you should also build and install
`parquet-cpp <https://github.com/apache/parquet-cpp/blob/master/README.md>`_.

Install `pyarrow`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. code-block:: bash

    cd arrow/python

    # --with-parquet enables the Apache Parquet support in PyArrow
    # --with-jemalloc enables the jemalloc allocator support in PyArrow
    # --build-type=release disables debugging information and turns on
    #       compiler optimizations for native code
    python setup.py build_ext --with-parquet --with-jemalloc --build-type=release install
    python setup.py install

.. warning::
    On XCode 6 and prior there are some known OS X `@rpath` issues. If you are
    unable to import pyarrow, upgrading XCode may be the solution.

.. note::
    In development installations, you will also need to set a correct
    ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``. This is most probably done with
    ``export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ARROW_HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH``.


.. code-block:: python

    In [1]: import pyarrow

    Out[2]:
