IPC: Fast Streaming and Serialization
=====================================

Arrow defines two types of binary formats for serializing record batches:

* **Streaming format**: for sending an arbitrary length sequence of record
  batches. The format must be processed from start to end, and does not support
  random access

* **File or Random Access format**: for serializing a fixed number of record
  batches. Supports random access, and thus is very useful when used with
  memory maps

To follow this section, make sure to first read the section on :ref:`Memory and
IO <io>`.

Writing and Reading Streams
---------------------------

First, let's create a small record batch:

.. ipython:: python

   import pyarrow as pa

   data = [
       pa.array([1, 2, 3, 4]),
       pa.array(['foo', 'bar', 'baz', None]),
       pa.array([True, None, False, True])
   ]

   batch = pa.RecordBatch.from_arrays(data, ['f0', 'f1', 'f2'])
   batch.num_rows
   batch.num_columns

Now, we can begin writing a stream containing some number of these batches. For
this we use :class:`~pyarrow.RecordBatchStreamWriter`, which can write to a writeable
``NativeFile`` object or a writeable Python object:

.. ipython:: python

   sink = pa.BufferOutputStream()
   writer = pa.RecordBatchStreamWriter(sink, batch.schema)

Here we used an in-memory Arrow buffer stream, but this could have been a
socket or some other IO sink.

When creating the ``StreamWriter``, we pass the schema, since the schema
(column names and types) must be the same for all of the batches sent in this
particular stream. Now we can do:

.. ipython:: python

   for i in range(5):
      writer.write_batch(batch)
   writer.close()

   buf = sink.get_result()
   buf.size

Now ``buf`` contains the complete stream as an in-memory byte buffer. We can
read such a stream with :class:`~pyarrow.RecordBatchStreamReader` or the
convenience function ``pyarrow.open_stream``:

.. ipython:: python

   reader = pa.open_stream(buf)
   reader.schema

   batches = [b for b in reader]
   len(batches)

We can check the returned batches are the same as the original input:

.. ipython:: python

   batches[0].equals(batch)

An important point is that if the input source supports zero-copy reads
(e.g. like a memory map, or ``pyarrow.BufferReader``), then the returned
batches are also zero-copy and do not allocate any new memory on read.

Writing and Reading Random Access Files
---------------------------------------

The :class:`~pyarrow.RecordBatchFileWriter` has the same API as
:class:`~pyarrow.RecordBatchStreamWriter`:

.. ipython:: python

   sink = pa.BufferOutputStream()
   writer = pa.RecordBatchFileWriter(sink, batch.schema)

   for i in range(10):
      writer.write_batch(batch)
   writer.close()

   buf = sink.get_result()
   buf.size

The difference between :class:`~pyarrow.RecordBatchFileReader` and
:class:`~pyarrow.RecordBatchStreamReader` is that the input source must have a
``seek`` method for random access. The stream reader only requires read
operations. We can also use the ``pyarrow.open_file`` method to open a file:

.. ipython:: python

   reader = pa.open_file(buf)

Because we have access to the entire payload, we know the number of record
batches in the file, and can read any at random:

.. ipython:: python

   reader.num_record_batches
   b = reader.get_batch(3)
   b.equals(batch)

Reading from Stream and File Format for pandas
----------------------------------------------

The stream and file reader classes have a special ``read_pandas`` method to
simplify reading multiple record batches and converting them to a single
DataFrame output:

.. ipython:: python

   df = pa.open_file(buf).read_pandas()
   df
