File interfaces and Memory Maps
===============================

PyArrow features a number of file-like interfaces

Hadoop File System (HDFS)
-------------------------

PyArrow comes with bindings to a C++-based interface to the Hadoop File
System. You connect like so:

.. code-block:: python

   import pyarrow as pa
   hdfs = pa.HdfsClient(host, port, user=user, kerb_ticket=ticket_cache_path)

By default, ``pyarrow.HdfsClient`` uses libhdfs, a JNI-based interface to the
Java Hadoop client. This library is loaded **at runtime** (rather than at link
/ library load time, since the library may not be in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH), and
relies on some environment variables.

* ``HADOOP_HOME``: the root of your installed Hadoop distribution. Often has
  `lib/native/libhdfs.so`.

* ``JAVA_HOME``: the location of your Java SDK installation.

* ``ARROW_LIBHDFS_DIR`` (optional): explicit location of ``libhdfs.so`` if it is
  installed somewhere other than ``$HADOOP_HOME/lib/native``.

* ``CLASSPATH``: must contain the Hadoop jars. You can set these using:

.. code-block:: shell

    export CLASSPATH=`$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs classpath --glob`

You can also use libhdfs3, a thirdparty C++ library for HDFS from Pivotal Labs:

.. code-block:: python

   hdfs3 = pa.HdfsClient(host, port, user=user, kerb_ticket=ticket_cache_path,
                         driver='libhdfs3')
