requirements:
- being a committer to be able to push to dist and maven repository
- a gpg key to sign the artifacts

to release, run the following (replace 0.1.0 with version to release):
# prepare release v 0.1.0 (run tests, sign artifacts). Next version will be 0.1.1-SNAPSHOT
dev/release/00-prepare.sh 0.1.0 0.1.1
# tag and push to maven repo (repo will have to be finalized separately)
dev/release/01-perform.sh
# create the source release
dev/release/02-source.sh 0.1.0 0

useful commands:
to set the mvn version in the poms
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=0.1-SNAPSHOT
