## Installation 

You first need to install the C++ library:

On macOS, you may install using homebrew: 

```
brew install apache-arrow
```

### From source

First install a release build of the C++ bindings to arrow.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/apache/arrow.git
cd arrow/cpp && mkdir release && cd release

# It is important to statically link to boost libraries
cmake .. -DARROW_PARQUET=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DARROW_BOOST_USE_SHARED:BOOL=Off
make install
```

## Then the R package

```r
devtools::install_github("apache/arrow/r")
```

## Example

```{r}
library(arrow)

(tib <- tibble::tibble(x = 1:10, y = rnorm(10)))
tab <- table(tib)
tab$schema
tab
as_tibble(tab)
```
